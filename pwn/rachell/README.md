**Really Abnormal Crazy sHELL**

In crazy August, I saw a cat playing TV game on the street at 2:00 AM.  
He was really drunken.  
I ate his left leg.  
And his left leg said in my stomach,  
" AT LAST I AM TOTALLY FREE NOW !! "

I answerd.  
" OK, THEN BRING IT ON !! "

This shell is something like that...

星を眺める一角獣は、枯れ果てた井戸に飛び込む

**フラグは /home/user/flag にあります**
